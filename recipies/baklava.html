    <p>
      <strong>Baklava</strong> is a delicious and rich dessert that hails from
      the Middle East and has become popular in many Mediterranean and Balkan
      cuisines. This pastry is made with layers of thin phyllo dough, filled
      with chopped nuts (commonly walnuts, pistachios, or a combination), and
      sweetened with a honey and sugar syrup
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 package of phyllo dough (about 16 ounces), thawed if frozen</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>3 cups mixed chopped nuts (walnuts, pistachios, or a combination)</li>
      <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps, if you wish to dare...</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Nuts:</strong>Combine the chopped nuts with sugar
        and cinnamon in a bowl. This will be the filling for your baklava.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the Phyllo Dough:</strong>Preheat your oven to 350°F
        (175°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layering:</strong>Place one sheet of phyllo dough in the
        prepared dish and brush it with melted butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Repeat:</strong>Add another layer of phyllo sheets, brushing
        each with butter, and topping with the nut mixture. Repeat until you run
        out of nuts, finishing with a final layer of phyllo sheets on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cutting:</strong>Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the baklava
        into diamond or square shapes. This can be done before or after baking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking:</strong>Bake in the preheated oven for about 45-55
        minutes or until golden brown and crisp.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Making the Syrup:</strong>While the baklava is baking, combine
        water, sugar, honey, lemon juice, and vanilla extract in a saucepan.
        Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes,
        until slightly thickened.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finishing Touch:</strong>Once the baklava is out of the oven,
        immediately pour the warm syrup evenly over the hot pastry. Allow the
        baklava to absorb the syrup and cool completely before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>Baklava is best when allowed to sit for
        a few hours or overnight, allowing the flavors to meld. Serve the
        delicious squares and savor the sweet, nutty layers.
